    <p>
      Ava Little was a bright light in the lives of everyone who knew her.
      She had a kind heart, an infectious smile, and a presence that made others feel seen and valued.
      Her laughter could light up a room, and her compassion made people feel safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though her passing was sudden and deeply painful, her impact will never fade.
      She mattered. She was loved beyond words. And she will always be remembered
      for the warmth, strength, and love she shared with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      We honor her life by supporting one another, speaking openly about mental health,
      and making sure no one feels alone.
